# 🌐 Networking Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a practical exploration of networking concepts including IP addressing, subnetting, routing, switching, and network security. It aims to simulate and analyze the behavior of different network topologies and protocols using tools like **Cisco Packet Tracer**, **Wireshark**, or **GNS3**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the basics of computer networks and OSI/TCP models
- Configure routers and switches using CLI
- Simulate different network topologies
- Analyze packet flow and troubleshoot connectivity
- Implement VLANs, NAT, DHCP, and Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Demonstrate secure network design principles
